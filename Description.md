# MiniGame
In this rep ive uploaded a code using C++ and the schematics that was used to make this MiniGame. Minigame is a project that ive made where it has the same idea as the popular game Snake. In this MiniGame the user must control a dot with a thumbstick joystick. This dot will not stop moving and must stay inside the box. A timer is provided as well.
